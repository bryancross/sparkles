# Security Policy

I strive to avoid security holes even in silly side projects like Sparkles.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a security vulnerability in Sparkles, reach out to me directly at [me@davidcel.is](mailto:me@davidcel.is).

_Please do not open a GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities!_ I will disclose vulnerabilities through GitHub once they're resolved, along with acknowledgement of the people who discovered them.
