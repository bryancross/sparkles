  long_description: Sparkles is a simple little Slack application for recognizing
    your teammates and friends. It's inspired by an old Hubot script that was
    very popular at GitHub and gave us a fun, silly way to share appreciation.
    When installed to a Slack workspace, a /sparkle slash command is added and
    you can get started immediately!
